# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, MongoDB

# Optimizations
Optimizations would include the user ability to place order, the barista logs in and can see the orders on a queue, once the order is done the barista marks it as complete and the order given to the customer.


# Lessons Learned 
* How to link pages in Javascript routes
* How to read the user data on the server side
* I would like to intergrate a voice that calls when an order is complete

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `node server.js`
2. Navigate to `localhost:8088`
